# TensorBro
Pytorch inspired Deep Learning framework from scratch for educational purposes.

This project is a fully featured autograd engine that supports
cpu as well as cuda. Maybe even more in the future.

It is based on the Tensor class, that keeps track of all operations
that are applied to it during the forward pass and then calculates
the gradients in the backward pass.

### Current Features
- [ ] nothing



### Planed Features
- [ ] add NumpyData
- [ ] create functioning Tensor class
